# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
#Introduction
Increased online purchases and the widespread use of electronic payment systems have made credit card fraud a severe problem. Global credit card fraud losses topped $32 billion in 2022, and until more sophisticated fraud detection tools are created, these losses are expected only to increase. Advanced fraud detection systems that can spot fraudulent behavior in real-time and minimize delays to legal transactions are becoming increasingly necessary as digital payments increase. This type of traditional fraud detection relies on predefined rules and guidelines for determining suspicion. Such systems are impractical because they cannot learn from the changing trends of fraudsters. They also produce a high number of false positives that bother users. In contrast, ML can provide a platform through which the learning model learns and adapts new behaviors by being driven by data. ML models are more successful because they can identify complex fraud patterns that rule-based solutions fail to spot [1], [2]. The extremely uneven nature of the data, where fraudulent transactions make up a small fraction of the total, is one of the main challenges in credit card fraud detection. This imbalance may lead to models that predict many legitimate transactions and miss many fraud cases [3]. Most of the models considered, in their attempts to achieve high accuracy, place more emphasis on the majority class that has greater relevance to less consideration of the crucial minority class. Addressing this asymmetry thus is imperative in the development of effective methods for fraud detection. This study investigates several ML techniques to detect fraud, like SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble Methods [4]. Models were chosen based on their performance in binary classification tests and their capacity to manage datasets with imbalances. Their performance is assessed using key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, emphasizing striking a balance between precision (which lowers false positives) and recall (which finds actual fraud cases). Resampling methods such as under-sampling, oversampling, and SMOTE resolve class imbalance to enhance model performance further. To lessen false positives and negatives for practical use, decision threshold tuning is being investigated to optimize the trade-off between recall and precision.


Traditional vs. ML-Based Fraud Detection

Rule-based algorithms for traditional fraud detection look for transactions that match predefined parameters, including the frequency and quantity of transactions. This is useful, but such systems tend to have significant false positives and take a long time to learn how to adapt to fraud's changing behavior. On the other hand, ML automatically learns from transaction data, identifies complex fraud patterns, and updates in real-time to reflect changes in fraud modus operandi [5].

Class Imbalance and Metrics Beyond Accuracy

Traditional criteria such as accuracy are inadequate in fraud detection because of the imbalance in most valid transactions. If the model predicts everything to be legit, it can reach very high accuracy levels but fail to detect actual fraud cases. Precision, recall, and F1-score are more relevant when measuring the model's performance.

-	Precision reduces false positives by calculating the proportion of correct fraud prediction in every instance where fraud is supposed to happen [6].
-	Remember this measures the percentage of actual fraud cases caught and is weighted towards the increase of fewer false negatives.
-	The F1 score is a performance metric that balances recall and precision.

Handling Class Imbalance with Resampling Techniques
-	Under-sampling results in fewer valid transactions, improving dataset balance but perhaps erasing essential data.
-	Also, oversampling has some chance of overfitting since fraudulent transactions are copied to balance the data set [7].

-	And to create a better model generalized in new data without overfitting, SMOTE produces artificial fraudulent cases [8]

Enhancing Model Performance with Threshold Adjustment. Modifying the decision threshold is a crucial component of strengthening model performance. Raising the threshold improves precision at the expense of recall, whereas lowering it promotes recall but may decrease precision. Fine-tuning this level makes finding the balance between reducing false positives and successfully identifying fraud situations easier. As a result, detecting credit card theft is difficult, and cutting-edge solutions are needed to stay up with changing fraud strategies. Machine learning models offer a more adaptable and efficient method than older methods, even though they still give some security. Machine learning models can reduce false positives and negatives while increasing fraud detection accuracy by mitigating class imbalance using methods such as resampling and decision threshold optimization.
